              <div class="desc">Banksys Girl With A Balloon is one of his most recognizable works. 
                With two simple shapes, <br>
                one burst of red, and a short faded statement, There is always
                hope Banksy is able to leave an <br> impressionable mark on viewers of this artwork. 
                The little girl is painted in black and white, <br> with little 
                detail, making her a universal subject matter. Her heart shaped balloon pops brightly,<br> signifying hope. 
                Here, Banksy creates a metaphor than can resonate with almost anyone who <br>is struggling or has struggled.</div>

              <div class="desc">Banksy’s street art ‘Keep your coins, I want change’ particularly finds itself relating to the harsh <br>treatment of people in society, to the point where they are left homeless and mistreated.<br> Essentially, Banksy’s work focuses upon messages that convey anti-war, anti-capitalism and <br>anti-establishment. Like Sister Corita’s messages, they both tend to focus on forms of politics, <br>with the two pieces falling into a message that puts the people into a mistreated place, while <br>the powers of control bathe in money and comfort.</div>

              <div class="desc">This piece is related to the ‘stop and search’ policy allowing Police to search any young people <br>they deemed may be up to no good was met with much criticism so it is no surprise to see <br>Banksy weigh in on the debate. Policeman Searching Girl appeared in London in 2007 showing<br> a young girl with a teddy bear being frisked by a policeman. It has since been painted out.</div>
